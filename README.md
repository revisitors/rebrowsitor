rebrowsitor
===========

bookmarklet to apply revisitor services to images in your browser

i'm planning to grab all images in the page, create a clone offscreen somewhere, use canvas to take a picture of it, run that through revisitors via xhr (maybe a menu of revisitors you can pick?), and then dynamically replace the original in the page with the funky one.
